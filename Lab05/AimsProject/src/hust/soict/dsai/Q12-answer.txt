What class should implement the Comparable interface?
The Media class.

In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method be to reflect the
ordering that we want?
We compare the two attributes of the object title and cost in their respective order.

Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) 
if we use this Comparable interface approach?
We can not because the compareTo method can only implement a single ordering rule at
a time.

Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by 
title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
We will use method overriding to override the compareTo method in the DigitalVideoDisc 
class, then we modify the compareTo method according to our order.
